jshell - JShell is an interactive tool introduced in Java 9 to provide developers with an environment for quickly prototyping and experimenting with Java code. 
" jshell " is command use for above purpose
to exit jshell
  command /ex or /exit 

 KEYWORD :
      keyword is the predefined word in java
      int myFirstNumber =5;

#java's primitive types
     whole number       real number
       byte        
      short              float       
       int               double
       long 
     single char        boolean value
        char               boolean

Integer.MIN_VALUE // integer is the wrapper class in java
//above and below integer value it can be overflow or underflow

WRAPPER CLASSES:
    java uses the concept of a wrapper class, for all of its eight primitive
    data types 
    A wrapper class provide simple operations, as well as some basic information 
    about the primitive , which cannot stored on the primitive itself

    byte store up to 8 bits
    short store up to 16 bits
    int stores up to 32 bits
    long stores up to 54 bits

# LONG   *but default int is long , if u donot l after assigning the value it will take upto the limit l *
     the number 100 , by default , is an int
     long is one of these types and its suffix is L or l
     this is the instance in java is not case sensitive , as lowercase'l' or an
     uppercase 'L' at the end of a whole number mean the same thing 

in float and double suffix is optional to use
       In Java, putting the f or F suffix at the end of a floating-point literal is necessary 
       to explicitly indicate that the number is a float type. By default, floating-point literals without
       a suffix are considered to be of type double.
  
      but where as it is not as necessary in double 
      double is precise than double so u donot have to give more precise value then
      double


myfloatValue = 5f/2f;
mydoublevalue = 5d/2d;

myfloatvalue = 5f/ 3f;
myfloatvalue==> 1.6666666

mydoublevalue = 5d/ 3d;
myfloatvalue==> 1.6666666666666667

// by default it is giving the double value 
mydoublevalue =5.00 /3.00
mydoublevalue ==> 1.6666666666666667

Q why double is better choice in most circumstances?
  1) it is actually faster to process on many modern computer because computer
     at the chip level , the functionality to actually deal with these double 
     numbers faster than the equivalent float.
  2) and java libraries has math function 
  3) creators of java selected the double becomes more precise , it can 
      handle larger range of numbers

//String are Immutable, but can be used much like primitive datatype
stringbuilder class is mutuable , but doesnot share the string's special
features, such a being able to assign it a string literal or use the + 
operator on it
