  STATIC keyword 
  static keyword if useful for representing meta data means data about data , means it is used to share the informatation about 
  class though by using static keyword information can be shared among all members of class

  static variables // if u have a very small information'
  static method // if u have lot's informatiom
  static class 
  static blocks

class HondaCity                                            price
{                                                     h1     10      h2

   int a , b;                                      //   price is the only one variable and it is 
                                                        shared by all the objects of the class
 static double onRoadPrice(String city)         
{                                                   // static variable can be accessing just knowing the
   switch (city)                                       price name 
  {                                                // static member can be called without creating the 
     case "delhi"                                     object 
          return price+price*0.1;                   // static memeber is present inside the method area
      case "mumbai"                                     and it is available once the class is loaded
          return price+price*0.09;
}                                                  
}                                                    properties of static methods
                                                     1)they belong to a class , they are comman for all
class Test                                            the method
{                                                    2) they can be called just by giving the class name we donot 
                                                       need to make object for it 
  p.s.v main()                                       3)  static method can access only static variables or other static methods
                                                        they can't access other non -static methods, variable
{                                               
  hondacity h1 = new hondacity();
  hondacity h2 = new hondacity();                 inside static methods u can't use the keyword like super or this
  s.o.p (hondacity.price);                            because all these represents instance of a class
}
}


eg 1

  public class Main                                       // the class which is loaded their static block
{                                                            will be loaded
    static
    {
        System.out.println("Block 1");                       output will be 
    }                                                         Block 1 and Block 2 
    public static void main (String [] args)
    {  }
    
    static 
     {   System.out.println("Block 2"); }
     
}




eg 2
and if we want to load the static block  of other class than we have to make the make object of that class



class test
{
    static
    {
        System.out.println("block1 ");
    }
    static
    {
        System.out.println("block 2");
    }
}


and if we want to load the static block  of other class than we have to make the make object of that class
public class Main
{
    public static void main(String []agrs)
    {
        test t = new test();
        System.out.println("Main");

    }

}
